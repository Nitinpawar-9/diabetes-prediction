# diabetes-prediction

-In this project we worked on publicly available diabetes dataset from scikit-learn.  
-We performed data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error and RÂ² score.Used Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for model development, training, and result visualization.

-The model provides insights into key health factors influencing diabetes risk, supporting early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.
